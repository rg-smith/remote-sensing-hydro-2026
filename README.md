# Remote Sensing and Data Analytics in Hydrology
Welcome to the github page for Remote Sensing and Data Analytics in Hydrology! A general description of the course is given below:

Students will learn about the principal tools for sensing the flux and condition of surface water and groundwater with airborne and spaceborne sensors. Fluxes that will be investigated include evapotranspiration, precipitation, and change in water storage in soil, surface water and groundwater reservoirs. Remotely sensed data from thermal, passive microwave, microwave radar and gravimetric sensors will be used to investigate these fluxes. Practical geological engineering problems such as groundwater depletion, slope stability and flooding will be investigated. Advanced GIS tools will be used for the analysis, and students will apply the data and tools learned for a term project of their choosing. Students are expected to have a working knowledge of GIS software for this course. Key learning objectives are:

-  Understand how remote sensing theory can be related to mapping and modeling different hydrologic states and fluxes, including precipitation, soil moisture, surface water and groundwater.
-  Learn how to analyze hydrologic remote sensing data using advanced open-source geospatial tools, such as python and QGIS.
-  Apply theoretical and practical knowledge of hydrologic remote sensing to a term project of the student’s choosing.
  
In this course, students will be using a combination of python and QGIS for class exercises and ultimately their term project. As python labs and course materials are covered, they will be posted here.
